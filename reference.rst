General information
-----------------------

Geoscan Lite – aerial photography complex that allows you to build a photographic map of the area, a matrix of heights or a 3D model of the territory.


**Application**

Complex Geoscan Lite is designed to obtain geo-linked photos of objects and aerial photography.

**Field of application**

The data obtained using the complex can be used for:

* Assessment of terrain;
* Perform aerial photography of the area with the fixation of the moments of photographing to obtain geo-referenced photos;
* Creation of orthophotos and digital terrain models based on aerial photography;
* Creation of height maps;
* Create 3D terrain models;
* Calculation of rock volumes in quarries and bulk objects.

Maintenance service
-------------------------

After each flight visually inspect UAV for damage.

In case of damage to the blades of the screw or keel, you can replace them yourself, using the spare parts and tools from the kit.

If structural damage to the airframe or systems is detected, contact the manufacturer.

After 80 flights it is recommended to send the UAV to the manufacturer for inspection and maintenance.



Storage
-----------

Complex Geoscan Lite (without battery) is recommended to be stored in a transport case (launcher should be stored in a bag) in dry rooms at a temperature of 5 to 25 °C and relative humidity not more than 80%, without condensation. Shelf life - 2 years.

Storage batteries should be stored in a cool, dry place, free from direct sunlight, at a temperature of 5 to 25 °C and a relative humidity of 80%, without condensation. The optimum temperature — from 5 to 10 °C. The optimum voltage level of the battery when placing the battery for storage: 15.12 V. Shelf Life - 1 year.
