Maintenance
-------------------------

After each flight, visually inspect UAV for a damage.

If propeller blades or keel is damaged, you can replace it yourself using spare parts and tools from the kit.

If structural damage to the airframe or systems is detected, contact ` Geoscan support <https://www.geoscan.aero/en/support>`_.

After 80 flights it is recommended to send your UAV to the manufacturer for inspection and maintenance.



Storage
-----------

Geoscan Lite complex (without battery) and launcher are recommended to be stored in a transport bags in dry rooms at a temperature of 5 to 25 °C and relative humidity not more than 80% without condensation. Shelf life - 2 years.

Batteries should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, at a temperature of 5 to 25 °C and a relative humidity of 80%, without condensation. Optimal temperature is from 5 to 10 °C. Optimum battery storage voltage level: 15.12 V. Shelf Life - 1 year.
