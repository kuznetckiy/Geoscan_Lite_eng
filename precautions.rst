Safety rules
=======================

**For safe use UAV, follow these operating instructions:**


* only persons who have been trained according to the "Plan of theoretical and practical training of the operator to control the unmanned complex GEOSCAN Lite" can launch and maintain the UAV;


* before the flight it is necessary to inspect the flight area and make sure that the planned flight path passes not less than 100 m above the terrain and high-rise objects (mountains, towers, pipes, transmission towers, etc.);


* choose the starting point without objects in the ±30° sector on the take-off path;


* the launch of the damaged complex is prohibited;


* before installing the rubber cords of the catapult, make sure that the safety lock is inserted. Remove the safety lock only before start;


* after connecting the battery power supply to the UAV is prohibited to be in the plane of rotation of the blades of the propeller UAV;


* don't exceed operational limits of height, mass and flight time of the UAV;


* don't launch UAV or fly near high power radio transmitters;


* don't allow unauthorized persons into the UAV launch area;


* when planning a UAV landing point, make sure that the UAV will land outside roads, power lines, ponds, and crowded places. Remember about the possible demolition of the parachute during the descent;


* avoid flying in crowded places.


**Observe the following operating precautions:**

* don't assemble or disassemble the UAV when the power is on;

* don't stay near the propeller when the power is on;

* installation and removal of blades of the propeller is allowed only when the power UAV is off;

* don't short circuit the battery.


**To avoid damage to parts of the complex:**

* transport UAV only in transport container;


* don't move the UAV elevons manually;


* when carrying UAV in the area of landing or launch, hold the fuselage;


* remove the lens cap of the camera only before the aerial survey;


* if the UAV gets into the water, it is necessary to immediately disconnect the battery and dry all structural elements, wires, connectors, electronic equipment;


* don't make changes in a construction of the UAV and launcher.


Operational restrictions
------------------------------

* Operating temperature range: -20 to +40 °С
* Max wind speed: 12 м/с

The aerial photography complex is not intended for flights during rain, snow and other precipitation.

The complex can't fly below height of the starting point.

In mountains you need to find lower point of flight task area for start. The entire flight route must pass above the starting point.
