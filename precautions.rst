Safety rules
=======================

**For safe use of UAV, follow these operating instructions:**


* UAV launch and maintainence can be held only by persons trained according to the "Plan of theoretical and practical training of the operator to control the unmanned complex GEOSCAN Lite";


* before the flight it is necessary to inspect the flight area and make sure that the planned flight path passes not less than 100 m above the terrain and high-rise objects (mountains, towers, pipes, transmission towers, etc.);


* There should be no high objects in ±30° takeoff sector. Max safe height of an object should be no more than 0.2L if L is the distance from takeoff point. 


* do not launch the UAV if any malfunction is detected;


* before straining the catapult rubber cords, make sure that the safety lock is plugged in. Safety lock must stay plugged in until the launch moment; 


* after connecting the battery to the UAV it is prohibited to be in the propeller blades rotation plane;


* don't exceed UAV's altitude, mass and flight time operational limits;


* don't launch or fly UAV near high power radio transmitters;


* don't allow unauthorized persons into the UAV launch area;


* when planning a UAV landing point, make sure that the UAV will land away from roads, power lines, ponds and crowded places. Remember about the possible drift of the parachute during the descent;


* avoid flying above crowded places.

**Follow these operating precautions:**

* don't assemble or disassemble the UAV when the power is on;

* don't stay near the propeller when the power is on;

* installation and removal of blades of the propeller is allowed only when the power UAV is off;

* don't short circuit the battery.


**To avoid damage to parts of the complex:**

* transport UAV only in transport bag;


* don't move the UAV elevons manually;


* when carrying UAV in the area of landing or launch, hold the fuselage;


* remove the camera lens cap only before the aerial survey;


* in case UAV gets into the water, immediately disconnect the battery and dry all structural elements, wires, connectors, electronic equipment;


* don't make changes in a construction of the UAV and launcher.


Operational restrictions
------------------------------

* Operating temperature range: -20 to +40 °С
* Max wind speed: 12 m/s

The aerial photography complex is not intended to fly during rain, snow and other precipitation.

The complex can't fly below starting point altitude.

In mountains conditions, find the lowest point of the area for flight mission start. The entire flight route must pass above the starting point.
