Assembly
-------------

1) Take the wings and the fuselage out from the transport bag of UAV.
2) Place the parachute in the parachute compartment (see section **Parachute system** for details).
3) Remove the top cover of the fuselage. To do this, unfasten the rubber straps on the nose of the fuselage, then remove the back of the cover from the grooves.

Parachute system
----------------------

Parachute system components:

   1 – parachute compartment cover;
   2 – parachute dome;
   3 – pockets for laying lines;
   4 – lines;
   5 – locking ring;
   6 – long static line;
   7 – short static line with the release ring system.


.. attention:: Before laying the parachute, make sure that the dome, lines and their attachments to the dome are not damaged. The dome and lines should be dry and clean. Re-pack the parachute if the previous packaging took place more than 10 days ago, or if it was transported by airplane.

****Parachute packing****

1) Check if the parachute is damaged in any way.
2) Make sure the lines are not tangled.
3) In the process of laying the parachute, make sure, that the lines are not tangled.
4) Control the position of the lines pockets. They must remain on the outer side of the folded dome.
5) Straighten the dome and fold it in half, aligning one side with other.

6) Fold the dome in half and align the edges.

7) As the result, the lines should be collected in 4 bundles with 4 lines in each.

8) Fold the dome in half again. The pockets for laying the lines must be outside.

9) Fold the dome as shown in the picture.

   Folding the dome

Make sure that while laying the parachute, the lines haven't get tangled. If necessary, straighten the lines out.

10) Put lines in the pocket, as you see in picture. To do this, measure the length of the bundle, it should exceed the depth of the pocket. Fold the  lines bundle in half and stretch in the pocket, so that the bend of the bundle a few centimeters protruded from the opposite side of the pocket. If necessary, you can eliminate the slack of the lines at the edge of the dome, pulling them over the bend on the opposite side of the bundle.

After laying the remaining lines into the pocket of the dome, locking ring is positioned between the loops of the lines.

12) Fold the dome as shown in the picture.

Installing the parachute in the UAV
-------------------------------------

1) Turn the UAV upside down so that the parachute compartment is up.
2) Pick up a carabiner and straighten the lines.
3) Put short static line end through the carabiner (as shown in the picture).

   Placing loop in the lock


.. note:: Make sure the release system is securely locked. To do that, hold to the parachute dome and pull it up sharply several times.

6) Carefully fold the parachute system ropes and line on the bottom of compartment.
