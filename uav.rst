Parachute system
----------------------

Components of the parachute system:

   1 – cover of the parachute compartment;
   2 – parachute dome;
   3 – pockets for laying rigging lines;
   4 – rigging lines;
   5 – locking ring;
   6 – long static line;
   7 – short static line with the unhook ring system.


.. attention:: Before laying the parachute, make sure that the parachute dome, rigging cables and their attachment to the dome are not damaged. The dome and rigging lines should be dry and clean. Re-lay the parachute if the previous packaging is more than 10 days ago, or you were carrying the complex in an airplane.

****Packing of the parachute****

1) Check that the parachute is not damaged.
2) Make sure the rigging lines are not tangled and the parachute cover is on the outside of the dome.
3) Make sure that in the process of laying the parachute rigging lines are not tangled.
4) Control the position of the rigging lines pockets. They must remain on the outside of the folded dome.
5) Straighten the dome and fold it in half, aligning the cutouts with each other.

   Folding the dome

Make sure that in the process of laying the parachute rigging lines are not tangled. If necessary, straighten the lines out.

9) Put rigging lines in the pocket as you can see in picture.
