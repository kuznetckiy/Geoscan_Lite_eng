Assembly
-------------

1) Take the wings and the fuselage from the transport bag of UAV.
2) Place the parachute in the parachute compartment (see section **Parachute system** for details).
3) Remove the top cover of the fuselage. To do this, unfasten the rubber locks on the nose of the fuselage, then remove the back of the cover from the grooves.

Parachute system
----------------------

Components of the parachute system:

.. figure:: _static/_images/para1.png

   :width: 300

   1 – cover of the parachute compartment;
   2 – parachute dome;
   3 – pockets for laying rigging lines;
   4 – rigging lines;
   5 – locking ring;
   6 – long static line;
   7 – short static line with the unhook ring system.


.. attention:: Before laying the parachute, make sure that the parachute dome, rigging lines and their attachment to the dome are not damaged. The dome and rigging lines should be dry and clean. Re-pack the parachute if the previous packaging is more than 10 days ago, or you were carrying the complex in an airplane.

****Packing of the parachute****

1) Check that the parachute is not damaged.
2) Make sure the rigging lines are not tangled.
3) In the process of laying the parachute, make sure, that rigging lines are not tangled.
4) Control the position of the rigging lines pockets. They must remain on the outside of the folded dome.
5) Straighten the dome and fold it in half, aligning one side with other.

6) Fold the dome in half and align the edges.

   Folding the dome in half second time

7) As the result, the rigging lines should be collected in 4 bundles with 4 rigging lines in each.

8) Fold the dome in half again. The pockets for laying the rigging lines mus be outside.

   Folding the dome pockets out

9) Fold the dome as see a picture.

   Folding the dome

Make sure that in the process of laying the parachute rigging lines are not tangled. If necessary, straighten the lines out.

10) Put rigging lines in the pocket, as you see in picture. To do this, measure the length of the bundle of rigging lines exceeding the depth of the pocket. Fold the rigging lines bundle in half and stretch in the pocket, so that the bend of the bundle a few centimeters protruded from the opposite side of the pocket. If necessary, you can eliminate the slack of the rigging lines at the edge of the dome, pulling them over the bend on the opposite side of the bundle.

After laying the remaining part of the rigging lines into the pocket of the dome ring is positioned between the loops of the rigging lines.

12) Fold the dome as see a picture.

Installing the parachute in the UAV
-------------------------------------

1) Turn the UAV so that the parachute compartment was on top.
2) Pick up a carabiner and straighten the rigging lines.
3) Put short static line end in carabiner (see a picture).

   Locking the loop in the lock


.. note:: Make sure the release system lock is securely locked. To do that, take the parachute dome and make some short sharp jerks.

6) Carrfully pack the ropes of parachute system and rigging lines.
